  <h2>Human Resources Professional <br> <span style="font-size: 0.7em; opacity: 0.8;">Focused on People, Process, and Brand</span></h2>

  <p>Hi, I'm Marie Claire. I work in Human Resources because I care deeply about how people experience their workplace. I believe the strongest organizations are built when employees feel supported, processes run smoothly, and the company's brand truly aligns with its internal culture.</p>

  <p>My favorite part of what I do is improving the employee experience — whether that's through engagement initiatives, thoughtful onboarding, or creating spaces where feedback turns into real action.</p>

  <h3>What Matters to Me</h3>

    <li>🌊 Improving employee engagement</li>
    <li>🌊 Streamlining processes for efficiency</li>
