    I built this site to showcase myself as an HR professional, as well as to demonstrate my abilities in website development. It's a space where I can share my experience, my approach to people and processes, and how I bring ideas to life both strategically and technically.

    Human Resources Professional Focused on People, Process, and Brand
  </h2>

  <p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
    Hi, I'm Marie Claire. I work in Human Resources because I care deeply about how people experience their workplace. I believe the strongest organizations are built when employees feel supported, processes run smoothly, and the company's brand truly aligns with its internal culture.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
    My favorite part of what I do is improving the employee experience — whether that's through engagement initiatives, thoughtful onboarding, or creating spaces where feedback turns into real action. I enjoy partnering with leadership to translate insight into improvements that employees can genuinely feel.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
    I'm equally passionate about operational efficiency. I love refining systems, simplifying processes, and building structures that make work clearer and more effective. When operations are strong, teams can focus on doing their best work.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
    I'm also drawn to the intersection of HR and brand alignment. Culture, communication, and external reputation should reflect each other. I enjoy thinking about how internal practices strengthen a company's identity and ensure that what's promised externally is lived internally.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
    At the heart of my work is a simple goal: create workplaces that feel intentional, aligned, and built to support both people and performance.
  </p>
