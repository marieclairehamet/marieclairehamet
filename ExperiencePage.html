<table>

		<td id="letter">
			Marie Claire Hamet is an extremely impressive talent for any business that is lucky enough to have her. I was lucky enough to have MC work for me at a door to door solar company. She had no prior sales experience and was coming from a position in retail, all she needed was the opportunity. She was coachable and hungry and quickly became a top sales rep, not only in the office but also across the East coast. To succeed in door-to-door sales, a person needs to be motivated, coachable, have thick skin, and have the ability to learn from failure. MC has these skills in spades and was able to do the very rare thing in any business; lead those around her. Her presence and knowledge made everyone around her better and any company would be lucky to have her.<br><br>
