ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! <br><br>
Iâ€™m Marie Claire Hamet, but you can call me MC! Yeah I know...MC Hamet ðŸ˜‚ and no my 
parent's didn't do it on purpose. <br><br>
Here's a little bit about me:
- Graduated and received Bachelor's Degree in 2019 from Hobart and William Smith
  - Major in Media and Society
  - Minor in Geoscience
- Completed an online course in Web Development with Coursera at UC Davis
  - Learned computer programs like:
      - HTMl
      - CSS
      - JavaScript
- Currently taking an online Interior Design course with the New York 
Institute of Design
- COVID-19 made me lose my previous job and I am now working at Mattress Firm in the meantime

I am looking for work in the web industry and will never be done learning :)
