	Welcome to my website! <br>(Available on other devices, too)<br><br> This site was created to show you who I am through my experience as a professional while showcasing my skills in web design. Think of it as a sort of resume :) <br><br> Go ahead and walk yourself through each tab. <br>...and I would highly suggest checking out the 'Connect With Me' tab...
